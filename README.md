# hearty-box

Hearty Box is a Flappy Bird clone that uses real-time Pulse Sensor data (Beats per minute) to change different mechanics of the game.

It uses an Arduino UNO microcontroller and a Pulse Sensor (from pulsesensor.com).

To set up and create the game, I did the following:

1) I loaded the PulseSensorStarterProject (https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensorStarterProject) Arduino code onto an Arduino UNO and attached the Pulse Sensor to it.

2) I modifed the PulseSensor_Amped_Processing_Visualizer (https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensor_Amped_Processing_Visualizer) Processing code to make the game.

Next, I aim to experiment and test how mapping BPM to different aspects of the game affect both enjoyment and stress levels.
